#Microservices over AMQP Demo

###Microservices are independently deployables services that perform small tasks. A bunch of Microservices can be used provide high availability, reliabilty and throughput.
The purpose of this demo is to use Microservices to illustrate the features of the powerful [AMQP protocol](http://www.amqp.org/resources/download). This uses open source [Qpid Proton](http://qpid.apache.org/proton/) library to generate AMQP messages and the [Dispatch Router](http://qpid.apache.org/components/dispatch-router/) for routing messages.
